This jQuery code snippet that identifies if the browser is Safari and if the operating system is either macOS or iOS. 
It then adds a class to the <body> element and applies css.

In this code, we use regular expressions and the navigator.userAgent property to check if the browser is Safari. 
We also check the navigator.platform property to determine if the operating system is macOS or iOS.
If the conditions are met, we add the class 'safari-mac-ios' to the <body> element using addClass().
Then, we can set the styles as we wish in ios devices.
